How to use project_analyze.sh script:

This script initializes when the user put the following command in ~CS1XA3/Project01 directory
./project_analyze.sh 

Then, the user will be given a set of options to choose which feature of the script he/she wishes to execute. 
As of right now (Friday, Feb 15, 2019), there is only one working feature in this script, which is: 1) TODO Log.
By Tuesday Feb 26, 2019, the user will have a set of at least 3 features to choose from.

These features are labelled with numbers, and the user is to input the corresponding number of the feature he/she wishes to execute.
(For example, if you want to execute the TODO Log feature of the script, input:
1
and hit enter.
